# Distilling-Deep-Networks

Looking to code from scratch and analyze behavior of Networks.

- Distribution of weights at every layer
- Evolution of the ratio of weights and update steps
- Code and try different Optimizers


---


Analyze how different combinations of architectures of networks, activation functions, learning_rate, batch_size change the perfomarnce on the test inference evaluating next picture, and the evolution of the gradients and the activations to see how the flow during the forward and backward passes respectively.

The examples shown will be for a simple 1 hidden layer CNN (Note 1 hidden layer has 2 layers of parameters W1 and W2)

Example of analyzing the weights:
